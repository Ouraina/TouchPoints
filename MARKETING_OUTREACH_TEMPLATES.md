Hi everyone! üëã

My family recently went through the chaos of coordinating Dad's care visits across 5 siblings. We were constantly double-booking, missing visits, and drowning in group texts.

‚Ä¢ Prevents double-bookings and empty visiting hours
‚Ä¢ Coordinates family visits in real-time
‚Ä¢ Sends smart reminders and notifications
‚Ä¢ Preserves precious photos and memories

We're offering a FREE 30-day trial to families who need this. No credit card required to start.

Would love feedback from other families dealing with this coordination nightmare!
